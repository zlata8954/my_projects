                <p>Housesale chose to work together with the Lebanese designer Nada Debs. We are thrilled to present
                    this
                    collaboration and the LJUV collection, and we hope that you can see, feel, use the connection
                    between a
                    designer from the Middle East democratic design.</p>

                <p>Nada Debs is a Levantine designer living and working in Beirut. Her work spans scale and discipline:
                    from
                    product to furniture design to one-off commission across craft, art, fashion, and interiors. Nada
                    grew
                    up in Japan, studied design in Rhode Island School of Design in the US, and has spent significant
                    periods living and traveling the world, finding connections of each of her experiences in all her
                    work.
                    She calls her approach handmade, and heart-made!</p>
